# Junit 5 migration to Java 9 modules

This is a small guide on how to partially migrate JUnit 5 platform to Java 9 modules. This is more a case study for "JUG Java 9 Jigsaw HackSession" rather than complete migration of JUnit 5 platform to Java 9. The goal is to show iterative approach of migrating real-life multi-module project to Java 9.

Please continue to [https://github.com/olegts/junit5/blob/hackday/MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/olegts/junit5/blob/hackday/MIGRATION.md), for further instructions on prerequisites, setup, etc... 

[JUG Ukraine](http://jug.ua/) have successfully conducted their hackday in Kiev, Ukraine on 12 Aug 2017 using the [jdk9-jigsaw repo](http://bit.ly/J9HackDay-repo) and the above migration material!
